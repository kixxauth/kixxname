### {{ actions }}
#### For fun and profit.

My focus is on bringing more customers to your cash register and helping you
streamline your workflow. I want to reclaim your precious time by listening to
you first, and then making stupid computers do all the work. {{ content\_first }}

### Straightforward pricing.
#### It&#39;s the honest thing to do.

I don&#39;t know about you, but if a seller cannot provide up to date pricing
that&#39;s easy to understand, I take my business elsewhere. That&#39;s the last
thing you should be wasting your time on.

### Local, Local, Local 
#### Small business rules!

I&#39;m a big believer in the strength of local business, so that&#39;s where I
focus my efforts, right here in {{ sub\_location }} and {{ super\_location }}.
In fact, I get so much satisfaction out of working with small businesses that I
offer a discount just for you. Check the [price schedule](/pricing) for more
information.

However, if your needs are larger or more complex than one computer guy can
handle, I'm also a partner in the best web development and software firm
ever... <a href="http://www.fireworksproject.com">The Fireworks Project</a>.
