This is what I do.
</h3>
<p class="content">
I do website design, e-Commerce, search optimization, and computer programming
for fun and profit. My focus is on bringing more customers to your cash
register and helping you streamline your workflow to get back more of your
precious time. I do this by listening to you first, and then making stupid
computers do all the work.

<h3 class="content">
Honest pricing.
</h3>
<p class="content">
You can expect transparent, straightforward pricing from me. It&#39;s the honest
thing to do.
</p>

<h3 class="content">
Local first.
</h3>
<p class="content">
I&#39;m a big believer in the strength of local business, so that&#39;s where I
focus my efforts, right here in {{ sub_location }} and {{ super_location }}.
We&#39;re all better off when small business thrives, don&#39;t you think?.

And, I should also mention that, if your needs are bigger than one computer guy
can handle, I'm also a partner in the best web development and software firm
ever... <a href="http://www.fireworksproject.com">The Fireworks Project</a>.
