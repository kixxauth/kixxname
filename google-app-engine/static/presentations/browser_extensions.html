<h1>The Docs</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla docs</a> can be a quagmire.</p>

<p>Migrating to a new format; Better? Maybe.</p>

<p>You can build <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/apps">applications</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/addons">extensions</a> on the Mozilla platform.</p>

<h1>The Mozilla Platform</h1>

<p><img src="http://people.mozilla.com/~schrep/theMozillaPlatform.png" alt="Mozill platform diagram." title="" /></p>

<h1>XPCOM</h1>

<p>Just like Microsoft COM (Component Object Model) except when it's not.</p>

<p>XPCOM is cross platform COM.</p>

<p>Components encapsulate with enforced interface contracts.</p>

<p>Components can be written in any language (in theory... but mostly just C++).</p>

<p>Components can be scripted in any language (in theory... but mostly in JavaScript).</p>

<p>The Mozilla Platform probably already has all the components you need.</p>

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<p>Almost all Mozilla applications are glued together with JavaScript.</p>

<p>It's not as bad as it sounds.</p>

<p>JavaScript <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb">book</a> for programmers of other means.</p>

<h1>XUL</h1>

<h2>Tastes just like html.</h2>

<ul>
<li>XML flavor</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Scriptable DOM</li>
</ul>

<p>Except:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strange (but useful) box model.</li>
<li><p>When it does work with JS libraries, it is often problematic.</p>

<p><code>xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h1>XUL Bindings.</h1>

<h2>Object oriented XML</h2>

<p>A binding is best thought of as a class in object oriented programming.  You
could also think of them as "widget builders."</p>

<p>A binding is built with a set of XUL, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Bindings are very powerful tools for people who enjoy pain.</p>

<h1>Overlays</h1>

<h2>Uniquely XUL</h2>

<p>Works by matching file names and id selectors along with a few other XUL
attributes.</p>

<p>Can be declared in a manifest file to be loaded at runtime, or programmatically
loaded with a supplied XPCOM component (using JavaScript).</p>

<h1>Bootstrapping the platform.</h1>

<p>The Mozilla platform makes internal use of two unique URL protocols:</p>

<ul>
<li>chrome:</li>
<li>resource:</li>
</ul>

<p>These urls are mapped to actual locations on the <em>local</em> file system.</p>

<p>This allows the platform to access files without really knowing where they are.</p>

<p>Files loaded from one of these protocols is given full privileges to do anything
that the platform is capable of.</p>

<h1>XULRunner</h1>

<h2>The holy grail of application development.</h2>

<p>The primary tool for bootstrapping the Mozilla Platform.</p>

<p>In fact, Firefox is a XULRunner Application.</p>

<p>Cross platform; write once; run everywhere; yadda, yadda, yadda.</p>

<p>If a user has Firefox installed, they also have XULRunner installed.</p>

<h1>Extending the Mozilla Platform</h1>

<h2>The main course.</h2>

<h3>The hooks for plugging into the platform.</h3>

<ul>
<li>install.rdf</li>
<li>chrome.manifest</li>
<li>overlays</li>
<li>bindings (forget about it)</li>
<li>Semi structured directory structure.</li>
</ul>

<h1>My quick and dirty strategy.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Create a bash script to fire up Firefox in dev mode.<br />
<code>#!/bin/bash</code><br />
<code>/home/kixx/Firefox/firefox -no-remote -P Developer</code></li>
<li>install.rdf</li>
<li>chrome.manifest</li>
<li>overlay.xul (add an item to the tools menu)</li>
<li>UI action opens an HTML page from a chrome: URL.</li>
<li>Import JavaScript with <code>&lt;script src=""&gt;</code> and get to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've recently been fooling around with <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS">CommonJS</a> too.</p>

<h1>Packaging and Deployment.</h1>

<p>Zip it all up into a zip file, but with an <code>.xpi</code> file extension.</p>

<p>Command line <code>zip -r myextension.xpi ./myextension/*</code> works great for this.</p>

<p><code>install.rdf</code> must be in the root.</p>

<p>May point to an <code>update.rdf</code> from the <code>install.rdf</code>. This must be hosted on https.</p>

<p>Security? Mozilla currently employs the "common sense" approach.</p>

<h1>JetPack and Addon Builder</h1>

<p>Attempting full IDE <a href="https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/">kits</a>.</p>

<p>Interesting premise (especially CommonJS)</p>

<p>Great potential, but IDE... Really? (just my opinion).</p>

The Docs
========
The [Mozilla docs][1] can be a quagmire.

Migrating to a new format; Better? Maybe.

You can build [applications][2] *and* [extensions][3] on the Mozilla platform.

The Mozilla Platform
====================
![Mozill platform diagram.](http://people.mozilla.com/~schrep/theMozillaPlatform.png)

XPCOM
=====
Just like Microsoft COM (Component Object Model) except when it's not.

XPCOM is cross platform COM.

Components encapsulate with enforced interface contracts.

Components can be written in any language (in theory... but mostly just C++).

Components can be scripted in any language (in theory... but mostly in JavaScript).

The Mozilla Platform probably already has all the components you need.

JavaScript
==========
Almost all Mozilla applications are glued together with JavaScript.

It's not as bad as it sounds.

JavaScript [book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb) for programmers of other means.

XUL
===
##Tastes just like html.
* XML flavor
* CSS3
* Scriptable DOM

Except:

* Strange (but useful) box model.
* When it does work with JS libraries, it is often problematic.

	`xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"`

XUL Bindings.
=============
##Object oriented XML

A binding is best thought of as a class in object oriented programming.  You
could also think of them as "widget builders."

A binding is built with a set of XUL, CSS, and JavaScript.

Bindings are very powerful tools for people who enjoy pain.

Overlays
========
## Uniquely XUL

Works by matching file names and id selectors along with a few other XUL
attributes.

Can be declared in a manifest file to be loaded at runtime, or programmatically
loaded with a supplied XPCOM component (using JavaScript).

Bootstrapping the platform.
===========================

The Mozilla platform makes internal use of two unique URL protocols:

* chrome:
* resource:

These urls are mapped to actual locations on the *local* file system.

This allows the platform to access files without really knowing where they are.

Files loaded from one of these protocols is given full privileges to do anything
that the platform is capable of.

XULRunner
=========
## The holy grail of application development.

The primary tool for bootstrapping the Mozilla Platform.

In fact, Firefox is a XULRunner Application.

Cross platform; write once; run everywhere; yadda, yadda, yadda.

If a user has Firefox installed, they also have XULRunner installed.

Extending the Mozilla Platform
==============================
## The main course.

### The hooks for plugging into the platform.
* install.rdf
* chrome.manifest
* overlays
* bindings (forget about it)
* Semi structured directory structure.

My quick and dirty strategy.
============================
* Create a bash script to fire up Firefox in dev mode.<br />
	`#!/bin/bash`<br />
	`/home/kixx/Firefox/firefox -no-remote -P Developer`
* install.rdf
* chrome.manifest
* overlay.xul (add an item to the tools menu)
* UI action opens an HTML page from a chrome: URL.
* Import JavaScript with `<script src="">` and get to work.

I've recently been fooling around with [CommonJS][17] too.

Packaging and Deployment.
========================

Zip it all up into a zip file, but with an `.xpi` file extension.

Command line `zip -r myextension.xpi ./myextension/*` works great for this.

`install.rdf` must be in the root.

May point to an `update.rdf` from the `install.rdf`. This must be hosted on https.

Security? Mozilla currently employs the "common sense" approach.

JetPack and Addon Builder
=========================

Attempting full IDE [kits][4].

Interesting premise (especially CommonJS)

Great potential, but IDE... Really? (just my opinion).

Mozilla Resources
=================
## Most useful docs:
* [Code Snippets][5]
* [XMPCOM Reference][6]
* [XUL Reference][7]
* [JavaScript Reference][8]
* [DOM Reference][9]
* [XULRunner Overview][10]
* [chrome.manifest][11]
* [Browser development settings][12]
* [Extension builder][13]
* [JetPack][4]

## XPCOM
* XPXOM as told by [IBM dev pages][14] 
* [Mozilla Overview][16]
* [Python Binding][15]: 

## Others
* [CommonJS][17]

Chromium
========
## And now for something completely different.

Totally sandboxed. You can't get anywhere near the metal.

The entire API is exposed with regular JavaScript. No interfacing with
component objects here.

This does two things:

* Limits what you can build.
* Makes building extensions really easy.

Totally Asynchronous API
========================
## Because that's the way of the real world.

[Google Docs][18]

The extension and its capabilities are defined at load time with a manifest
called `manifest.json`.

Every API call takes a dictionary object which specifies the parameters of the
call, and a callback funtion to invoke with the result when it is ready.

This standardized API actually makes good intuitive sense.

The sandboxes.
==============
* Background pages.
* UI widgets.
* Page Scripts.

All of these are declared in the `manifest.json` at load time.

Main component of functionality is the background page.

Communication between background pages and UI widgets is done with
direct (async) JavaScript calls.

Page scripts have access to the DOM of loaded websites but must proxy any
information they get back to the background page with encoded text messages.

Building and deployment.
========================
## So easy, it shouldn't even have a slide.

It's all done from the extension manager (settings - tools - extensions)
